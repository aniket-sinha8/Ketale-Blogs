                    <p>Hey Peeps, what's up??<br>So if you are a potterhead, you must be familiar to the title of my blog, if not then let me brief you what it means in short, its a magical spell... yes you heard it right!! its a spell used in harry potter
                        books/movies which means TO FORGET.!! I don't know why but every time when i read Harry Potter this spell fascinates me the most. So yesterday when I was watching harry potter movies, i thought as we all have so much free time
                        due to lockdown, so i thought to give a thought that why this spell fascinates me.. "OBLIVIATE" I mean why? Fair enough to give a thought??<br></p>
                    <p>As a result of this thinking process.. oops sorry overthinking process, haha, i realized that we, particularly me wants to forget so many things that happened in my life. yesss..&nbsp; we all want to forget some of our past experiences..
                        like we want to vanish those moments from our brains completely.. then again as i said i was overthinking, so i started pondering that how to do it??<br>I mean more i think the more i am drowning into this.. then how to achieve
                        it?? How to erase all those memories or moments which actually binds me from being a happy person,&nbsp; which holds me when i open up, which limits me to not have fun on my best days and which made me cry even harder on my worst
                        days.... Will those unhealed wound ever stop to bleed??<br></p>
                    <p>Then i wondered, in our lives we all have some moments which we want to forget but they are unforgettable, whether its our first break up&nbsp; or first love or our first failure or stabbing a friend, stabbed by a friend, an unsolved
                        dispute with our parents, losing a friend/family, death of loved ones or those mental or physical assault or friend-zoning someone we admire the most or staying in an loveless relation...etc...etc.. and this list is endless!!<br></p>
                    <p>We all are living our lives to fullest but my question is are we alive??? many will say yes, we are breathing, so biologically!!! but i will say ask your mind again, are you ALIVE??(ask gently to yourself)<br>There are so many things
                        which goes in our brains and never comes out. We all have so many secrets we are afraid to share to even ourselves. In today's era, we all have that void in our lives which is making us less emotional and more caffeinated! We are
                        living, of course sometimes laughing, partying, playing but at night when we go to bed, THAT ONE THING again won't let us have a peaceful night. The question still remains the same how to forget that?? How to disconnect all your
                        stories??<br></p>
                    <p>So Today, i was watching DEAR ZINDAGI, no no not for the first time but yess for the first time i saw the different angle in the movie..i didn't thought about the chair thing said by SRK or the song dear zindagi or go to hell dil..
                        all i did was understanding the real meaning of this quote "KHULE KE HASNE KE LIYE KHUL KE RONA PADTA HAI" so true.. so deep.. so honest!!<br></p>
                    <p>To forget something, we must accept it first.. i know you will say, bolna aasan but reality mai you can't!! Try me,!! accepting something is talking about it.. NO you wont forget those moments but by talking about them, grieving about
                        them, crying for them for an hour or day or a month your heart will definitely overcome from that, just like vaccines.<br></p>
                    <p>Remember those scars on your elbows, when you fell down from cycle.. yes you cried for weeks but look now even if you have a scar, you are okay with it!! you are healed.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>See the problem is not that we all have some problems, it's a fact that we don't have anyone to listen to. we don't trust anyone.. the idea of being judged by someone drags us from narrating the story.. This is because we all wants
                        to speak. We all think our problems are biggest and must be understood as they are important.. yess exactly your problem is important but we can't scale it. i mean you are wearing your shoe, others are wearing theirs... It's that
                        we all want to be heard but not to listen. we think no one listens to us, so why do.. right??&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>So HEY guys this is SHREENIDHI , and i have a dream, of course all dreams to be something some day..so my dream is i want to be a Public Speaker.. yea right that's not something hard to achieve.. #giggles now most of you would be thinking
                        that she herself wants to be a speaker and taunting us for being one.. Don't get me wrong. The thing is, to be honest i am selfish person because to be a great speaker one has to be a good listener.. that's why i want to listen.
                        So i thought aise toh no one will trust me and tell me their stories. people will judge me as a fraud if i go to every individual and ask them about things or incident they aren't comfortable discussing with their own soul....
                        but i know many of you wants to be heard, you want to find consonance, faith, willpower, love, care, attention or just an ear to listen, shoulder to cry..so i created this platform where will discuss, talk and especially hear to
                        solve those unheard voices who really wants to forget something by sharing them.<br></p>
                    <p>So in this lockdown time, while sitting in your comfy beds share with me your scars so we can wear them with pride rather than hiding them with cloth from this evil "CHAR LOG WALI SOCIETY".. Because now we are here to hear you...Yes!!<br></p>
                    <p>Whether it's hidden confessions, sexual assaults, mental torture or just a bad day vibe... you must know you have a friend who won't judge but will definitely listen you!!<br>and to be fair, this blog doesn't have much followers so
                        it won't be heard by critics or many!! hahaha<br>Eagerly waiting for amazing comments and exciting stories!!<br>Yours and only yours..<br>Listener!!&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>It's time we initiate to "OBLIVIATE"!!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>Are you excited for hearing some unheard voices or being one whose story is still wrapped with her soul?? please like comment and don't forget to share.&nbsp;<br></p><a href="#"></a></div>
