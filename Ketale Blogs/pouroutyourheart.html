                    <p><br>“Last week, I was having lunch with my family and all of sudden I was lost. I started staring the wall in my dining area and my mind was blank. All of sudden as if happiness has been disappeared from my life. just as dementors
                        had attacked me I felt so sad and exhausted that I was unable to hold it and started crying. since I was with my family so I could control my emotions and hold the tears before it could roll on to my face. Quickly i finished my
                        dinner with heavy heart and slipped into my room, and once again the vacuum was around me in that dark room which was forcing me to stare at that blank wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was unable to figure out why I was feeling so obnoxious
                        and numb at that time. My brain was storming. yes, it was wandering but where?? i have no freaking idea. My life seemed so hopeless and pointless for that time i can't express. I was dead for the mement. You know me buddy, I always
                        have answers but this time I was devastated. Is it normal?? Why this happened? Is this happened to you too.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;~Priya<br></p>
                    <p>So I got this text in reply to my first post, and I started unscrambling the words, she wrote her emotions in very complicated manner as she was not sure about the choice of words, in short, she was so confused about what to share
                        what not too. Her unfinished lines made me wonder that she has too many unfinished chapters in her life.<br></p>
                    <p>Have you people heard about a phrase, “<strong><em>Every beginning begins with an end</em></strong>.” We all have some unsorted or unsolved issues which holds our back. So to start something new first we need to bid a goodbye to the
                        old ones. Bidding a bye is never an easy task that why we never do it and as a result we always hold that unfinished end as a burden on our head.Thinking about all those unsolved issues of my life, i courageous asked Priya, do
                        you think that is there something which bothers you, I mean where do you go in these blackouts?? What your mind questions you during that time? Have you met some unfinished stories?She laughed and replied, who doesn’t have? I told
                        her to share her story. She said that this is it? I insisted to speak more then she replied they will judge me? I asked who they? She replied in her weeping voice, ’Society’.<br></p>
                    <p>I promised to help her by not judging but try to understand her side of story. Sharing your emotions won’t help because you are not bringing out what you are really afraid about. You are definitely discussing your problem but in a
                        generalized way. If you want to move forward you need to express it in personalised way. Everyone has different story so each story needs to be heard. More the story is yours quicker the solution will be found. After around 20
                        minutes she told me that what actually bothers her.<br></p>
                    <p>She said in a hesitating manner, “<em>I am a mess, I don’t know from where to start, the thing is… I once loved someone very very&nbsp;&nbsp;much, I mean more than infinity but that guy, he was a jerk, he broke me in fact he just simply walked out of my life. I still get haunted by the thoughts of him. Whenever I hear similar name, I started having goose bumps. He didn’t breakup with me. He didn’t tell me that he wants to end this. he just disappeared all of sudden from my life. As if I was not part of his life. No I don’t love him anymore I am not a Romeo type person who won’t move on. but he was my friend before my lover. At least he should have respected that. I question my self-worth that was I not that good friend that he can come and tell me that he doesn’t want to be with me. He might have forgotten that I was the same old friend whom he called the most understanding person? Why he ditched me like this. I was more hurt because of his style of leaving rather than the fact he left me.Anyways it’s been 4 years and time is best healer. I met many people, dated some but never actually wanted anyone to stay forever, because I knew some day they will leave. My life was normal and simple before I met this guy. His name is ruhaan, someone who was not so special. I knew him for some time as some nerd who had a crush on me, oh you know naa I am a sapiosexual. This guy came into my life as an amazing friend. Honestly speaking I really liked his company. His intellectual thoughts, his style of praising me in fact his sarcastic comments were icing to the cake. I really felt happy being around him, he has become my happy place. I used to think that he no longer has crush on me and with are good friends. As he told me this. He was for me a go-to person. I was happy as finally I was making some new memories and wanted to make to make many so that all those scars which I had from past get lost in the dusk. I now was finally not thinking about those walk-outs I have faced. But destiny had different plans for me. Idk why god doesn’t like me happy, one fine day rather being my happy place he chose to put salt to my scar. Yes, he too disappeared. No calls, no replies nothing. Just departed from my life. He didn’t consider of informing me, discussing with me or anything.I, I went in my hole again. I lost myself. I started thinking that maybe it’s me. I do some stuff that take people away from me. I am guilty because this happens with me only. I started living in four walls, I used to meet people but day by day I was becoming a lifeless soul. No, I haven’t given up my hope in life but definitely I was done with these strong bonds. After few months, life was back to normal. Some fun day with friends and family but that void still find its place. My life is filled with thrills so one fine day I somehow managed to bump into him, yes Ruhaan, I met him again .This time I was drunk so I&nbsp;&nbsp;got the guts to ask that why he left, I mean at least must tell me my fault before leaving. Whatever he said was pleasantry yet scaring. He said he started falling for me but my personality says I cannot love someone so he doesn’t want to be friend-zoned. That’s why to be on safer side he left. I said I could have said yes, because you know I liked spending time with you. Fair enough he asked me out on the very next moment. I was shocked and numb that what now?&nbsp;&nbsp;This was an unexpected call, i felt like I just fallen from 12 floors and hit the ground. I said no, now I cannot say yes. I no longer have faith that you won’t leave me.That was my last meet to him 4 months ago, but till today, I am thinking about him. Because after that day I haven’t thought about my ex or any other scar the only thing which I think is whether I did the right thing or not?One mind says that I must call him and tell him how I started feeling for him other says that the one who left you once can repeat it and if broken this time you won’t be able to amend yourself??What should I do?? All the time I think about should I call him and tell him how I feels or I should let it go? I want to come out of this hole but I am trapped. You understanding??”</em><br></p>
                    <p>After hearing her story, I was speechless. I don’t know what to tell her because even I don’t know what will I do if I were at her place. She is a whore for society who switches from one to another. But in reality, whenever she tries
                        to settle down, her fate denies.<br></p>
                    <p>To my lovely readers, please tell me what to tell her to ease her pain. what should she do now? Call him or forget him???YoursListener&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>Yours Listener.&nbsp;<br></p><a href="#"></a></div>
